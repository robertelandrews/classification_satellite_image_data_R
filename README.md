# Classification of Satellite Images in R
I deploy numerous classification algorithms to detect survivor locations with satellite image data. The dataset contains aerial pictures of Haiti following the 2010 earthquake. The goal is to locate survivors by detecting blue tarps in the images. Survivors created lean-to shelters using these tarps.
